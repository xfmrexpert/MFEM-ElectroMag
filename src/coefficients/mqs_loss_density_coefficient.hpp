/**
 * @brief Time-averaged Joule loss density \f$P = \frac{1}{2}\sigma|E|^2\f$
 *        with \f$E = E_{drive} - j\omega A\f$.
 *
 * The factor \f$\frac{1}{2}\f$ is the time average of a product of
 * peak-amplitude phasors. This peak (amplitude) convention matches the
 * coupling-matrix extraction \f$R = \mathrm{Re}(V/I)\f$ used elsewhere in this
 * project, and the convention of the common commercial AC/DC and eddy-current
 * tools. Passing RMS phasors instead would apply the averaging twice and halve
 * every reported loss.
 *
 * @warning The convention is established by the prescribed excitation value
 * (see Excitation in problem_config.hpp) and is carried unscaled through the
 * RHS into the solved potentials and port voltages. It is documented but NOT
 * enforced: no code validates or converts it. An RMS excitation -- the natural
 * reading of a nameplate current -- is silently accepted and halves every
 * number this coefficient produces. See docs/faq.md, "Are excitations peak or
 * RMS?", for the user-facing statement of this hazard.
 *
 * Splitting \f$E\f$ into real and imaginary parts with
 * \f$A = A_{re} + jA_{im}\f$, so that
 * \f$-j\omega A = \omega A_{im} - j\omega A_{re}\f$, gives
 * \f[
 *   \mathrm{Re}\,E = E_{drive,re} + \omega A_{im}, \qquad
 *   \mathrm{Im}\,E = E_{drive,im} - \omega A_{re}.
 * \f]
 *
 * @par Why the drive term cannot be dropped
 * The simplification \f$P = \frac{1}{2}\sigma\omega^2|A|^2\f$ is valid ONLY
 * where \f$E_{drive} = 0\f$. That holds for conductive regions with no port
 * unknown (a flux shield or a steel brace), but NOT for massive terminals or
 * open-current regions, whose solved port voltage is exactly what enforces
 * their current constraint. Using the simplified form there silently under- or
 * over-reports the loss, so the drive term is carried explicitly.
 *
 * The per-attribute drive table is zero-initialised and populated only where a
 * port unknown exists. Unported conductors therefore fall out of the general
 * expression with no special case, which is why this one coefficient serves
 * driven terminals, open-current regions, and passive conductors alike.
 *
 * @par Geometry
 * Geometry enters in one place only. For an azimuthal massive conductor the
 * drive field produced by a port voltage \f$V\f$ is
 * \f$E_\phi = V/(2\pi r)\f$, the same physical \f$1/r\f$ that appears in
 * AxisymmetricConductanceCoeff. That factor is a property of the field, and is
 * entirely distinct from the \f$2\pi r\f$ volume measure supplied by the
 * integrator when this density is integrated. Integrating this coefficient
 * with a planar integrator on an axisymmetric problem therefore omits that
 * measure and yields a per-radian, not a total, loss.
 *
 * @par Assumed background
 * The vector potential is assumed to be the azimuthal component \f$A_\phi\f$ of
 * a time-harmonic solution at the single frequency @a omega, in the same peak
 * phasor convention as the drive amplitudes. The induced field
 * \f$-j\omega A\f$ is only the whole story because the formulation is
 * quasistatic: displacement current is neglected.
 *
 * @par Limitations
 * - Linear, isotropic, non-hysteretic conduction only. This is resistive
 *   dissipation alone; hysteresis and excess (anomalous) losses are not
 *   represented, so total loss in laminated steel is underestimated.
 * - Single-frequency only. The result is meaningless for a transient solution
 *   or for a superposition of several frequencies.
 * - Axisymmetric mode assumes an azimuthal conductor on an \f$(r,z)\f$ mesh and
 *   reads the radius from component 0 of the transformed point.
 * - A driven azimuthal conductor may not touch the symmetry axis; see Eval().
 *
 * @par Ownership and lifetime
 * @a sigma, @a a_re and @a a_im are held by reference and are NOT owned. The
 * caller must keep all three alive for the lifetime of this coefficient, and
 * must rebuild this object if a mesh refinement invalidates the referenced
 * GridFunction objects. The two drive tables are copied and are self-owned.
