"""Generate the current-loop mesh from a Netgen GEOMETRY definition.

STATUS: one-off feasibility probe, not a supported tool. Nothing in the build
or the test suite runs this. It is kept only as the reproducible artifact behind
the measurements in docs/mesh_formats.md, and it requires a Netgen install that
is not a project dependency. If the Netgen question is ever closed -- either way
-- this script can be deleted.

This is the second half of the Netgen feasibility study (see
docs/mesh_formats.md). The first half only proved MFEM can READ an areamesh2
file; this script proves we can DRIVE Netgen from a geometry description and
get a mesh whose attribute ids we control well enough to hand to a config.

The geometry mirrors test/test_solvers.cpp: an axisymmetric (r, z) half-plane
containing a square-section conducting loop of radius kLoopRadius, surrounded
by air out to a far boundary at kLoopDomain.

Attribute contract (must match examples/current_loop/config.json):
    domain   1 = air, 2 = loop conductor
    boundary 1 = axis (r=0), 2 = outer, 3 = top/bottom

Run:
    $env:PATH="C:\\netgen\\bin;$env:PATH"
    $env:PYTHONPATH="C:\\netgen\\lib\\site-packages"
    python tools/netgen_current_loop.py loop_netgen.mesh

# assumed: the geometry declares the role, the code derives the number.
